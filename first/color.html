<h1>Marine Biology</h1>
<h2>The Composition of Seewater</h2>
<p>Almost everything can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved 
materials from Earth's crust as well as materials released from organisms. 
The most important components of seawater that inluence life forms are salnity, 
temperature, dissolved gases(mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients and pH. 
These elements vary in their compositions as well as in their influence on marine life.
