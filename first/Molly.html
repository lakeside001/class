       <h2><u>Chapter 1</u><h2/>
        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now.
          On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>,
          and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in was a well thumbled copy
          of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college and the longer
          she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free</p>
<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that 
<q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>.
Although many considered her pioneering work unraveling the secret of the llama 
<abbr title=<strong>"Deoxyribonucleic acid"</strong>DNA</abbr> to be an outstanding achievement. 
Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
